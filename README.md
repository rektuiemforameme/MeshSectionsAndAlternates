# Mesh Sections and Alternates (WIP)

This WIP addon will generate different meshes based on sections defined in a base mesh's vertex groups and alternate mesh parts defined in seperate meshes. 

It doesn't work right now, because I was a fool and didn't create this repo until after I had lost a lot of progress.
